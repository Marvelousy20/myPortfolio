        I'm AFOLABI MARVELOUS S, a highly motivated, result oriented front-end developer,
        lover of music, video games and animals.  I'm a positive, intelligent calm but proactive young man with a successful background in proper
        execution of task within a given time frame. Good team player with above average mathematical skills.
        I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I also use frameworks like bootstrap and tailwindCSS. 
        I am a student of Obafemi Awolowo University.
        I love to solve problems with available tools. I'm a fast learner and I hope to learn a lot of 
        things this year.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I started my programming journey about four years ago. The main reason why I wanted
        to become a developer was to help the world by building applications useful for
        me and the society. I was also fascinated by the way code was written. Due to the fact
        that my laptop was at a very bad condition then, I couldn't fully concentrate on writing 
        code until late 2018. <br/><p class="control"><button type="button" class="read">Show more</button></p>

        <span class="hide-at-first">
            The reasons I started programming still haven't changed. I love technology and
            I want to help the world become a better place through technology. I love learning.
            Learning never ends and I hope to continue learning. <br/>
            <br/>
            Currently, I learn with different resources both textbooks, youtube,
            stackoverflow and so on.
            I am also a pro member of <a id="egghead" href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a>
            where I learn a lot from great instructors. I look forward to working with
            great teams with ambition to help make the world a better place.
